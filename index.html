                <p>The <strong>Mission Pinball Framework</strong> (“MPF”) is
                a free Python-based pinball software framework that’s used to
                run real pinball machines. However, to build pinball machines you
                also need hardware which is where <strong>Mission Pinball
                Hardware</strong> ("MPH") comes in.</p>

                <p>MPF contains PCBs to connect common hardware, 3D models for
                mechs and more.</p><br>

                        <p>There is a lot of electronics needed to run a pinball machine.
                        Some of it can be bought off-the-self but other parts are custom to the machine.
                            We maintain a <a href="/pcbs.html">list of custom PCBs with schematics</a>
                            to customize and fabricate according to your needs.
                        This includes light boards, optos, custom mechs, complete control boards and more.

                        <p>As a pinball machine contains a lot of different parts below and above the
                        playfield it makes sense to model everything in a CAD program.
                        We maintain a <a href="/cad-models.html">list of CAD models</a>
                            which can be used to model standard parts.
                        If possible we try to validate that those models are correct and note who used them already.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, we list a few models which are intended to be 3D printed.
                        This contains holders, mounts and even complete mechs.
                        Some are only intended for prototyping others could also be used in a final machine.</p>
